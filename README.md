# MLProjects by DanishAhmed33

An end-to-end collection of machine learning and data science projects built using Jupyter notebooks and a simple web app. Projects range from data preprocessing and exploratory analysis to building and deploying predictive models.

## 🧠 Projects Overview

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Notebooks/** | Collection of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating full ML pipelines—data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization. |
| **src/** | Core Python modules supporting notebooks and app logic. |
| **app.py & application.py** | Streamlit/Flask-based apps enabling interactive exploration or prediction interfaces. |
| **artifacts/** | Model artifacts and serialized objects (e.g., sklearn pipelines, CatBoost models). |
| **catboost_info/** | Logging, evaluation metrics, and feature importance generated during CatBoost training. |
| **templates/** | HTML/Jinja2 templates if using Flask for web app front-end. |

## 🔧 Setup & Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DanishAhmed33/mlprojects.git
cd mlprojects
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate.bat     # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

### Running Notebooks

Launch Jupyter and open any notebook in the `notebook/` folder:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

### Running the Web App

To start the demo app:

```bash
python app.py
```

*Adjust the entrypoint to `application.py` depending on project structure.*

### Packaging

(Optional) If applicable:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Explore notebooks to learn about datasets, feature engineering, modeling, and interpretation.
2. Use `app.py` or `application.py` to interactively test models (e.g., make predictions, visualize model behaviors).
3. Adapt or extend the codebase to new datasets or business problems.

---

## ✅ Key Features

* End-to-end ML lifecycle: from cleaning raw data to deploying models.
* Support for CatBoost models with full logging and feature importance extraction.
* Modular code structure enabling reusability and extension.
* A simple web interface for demos and user interaction.
